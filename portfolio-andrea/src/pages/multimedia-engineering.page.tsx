              Final Degree Project (TFG)
            </h3>
            <p>
              My{" "}
              <strong>
                Final Degree Project consisted of developing a serious game for
                children
              </strong>
              , designed to teach mathematics in a playful and engaging way,
              avoiding content being perceived as boring or strictly academic.
              In this project, I took full responsibility for the front-end and
              user experience.
            </p>
            <p>Key aspects of the project included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li className={listStyle}>
                <strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> I created{" "}
                <strong>personas</strong> and <strong>user journeys</strong> for
                a child audience, segmenting by age and interests, ensuring each
                interaction promoted motivation, exploration, and positive
                reinforcement.
              </li>
              <li className={listStyle}>
                <strong>UX/UI Design:</strong> I designed the entire interface
                and user experience using <strong>Adobe Creative Cloud</strong>{" "}
                and <strong>Figma</strong>, creating child-friendly visuals,
                clear graphic elements, and gamification mechanics such as
                rewards and visible progression.
              </li>
              <li className={listStyle}>
                <strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> I programmed the game
                logic and interactions using <strong>GDevelop</strong>, managing
                events, adaptive difficulty levels, and a system for tracking
                childrenâ€™s progress.
              </li>
              <li className={listStyle}>
                <strong>Evaluation and Continuous Improvement:</strong> I
                conducted tests with real users, collecting qualitative and
                quantitative feedback, refining the logic, interface, and
                educational tone to ensure the game met its learning goals while
                remaining fun and engaging.
              </li>
              <li className={listStyle}>
                <strong>Results:</strong> The project resulted in a fully
