          Final Degree Project (TFG)
        </h3>
        <p>
          My{" "}
          <strong>
            Final Degree Project consisted of developing a serious game for
            children
          </strong>
          , designed to teach mathematics in a playful and engaging way,
          avoiding content being perceived as boring or strictly academic. In
          this project, I took full responsibility for the front-end and user
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>Key aspects of the project included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li className={listStyle}>
            <strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> I created{" "}
            <strong>personas</strong> and <strong>user journeys</strong> for a
            child audience, segmenting by age and interests, ensuring each
            interaction promoted motivation, exploration, and positive
            reinforcement.
          </li>
          <li className={listStyle}>
            <strong>UX/UI Design:</strong> I designed the entire interface and
            user experience using <strong>Adobe Creative Cloud</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Figma</strong>, creating child-friendly visuals, clear
            graphic elements, and gamification mechanics such as rewards and
            visible progression.
          </li>
          <li className={listStyle}>
            <strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> I programmed the game
            logic and interactions using <strong>GDevelop</strong>, managing
            events, adaptive difficulty levels, and a system for tracking
            childrenâ€™s progress.
          </li>
          <li className={listStyle}>
            <strong>Evaluation and Continuous Improvement:</strong> I conducted
            tests with real users, collecting qualitative and quantitative
            feedback, refining the logic, interface, and educational tone to
            ensure the game met its learning goals while remaining fun and
            engaging.
          </li>
          <li className={listStyle}>
            <strong>Results:</strong> The project resulted in a fully deployable
            product, demonstrating my ability to lead a complete multimedia
            development process from concept to delivery, integrating{" "}
            <strong>UX/UI, programming, and pedagogy</strong>.
